                <p>I was born to a family of a sailor on a submarine. My family is not small. There are four of us. When
                    I was 7, I went to school. I did well at school. I was especially good at math and geometry, but
                    also coped with the rest of the subjects. Thus from the point of view of my progress at school I
                    didn't cause much trouble to my parents. But I did make them worry because I used to come home
                    rather late. The thing is I went in for swimming and our training finished at about 7 p.m. I lived
                    far from the swimming-pool, so it took me quite a lot of time to get home. When at school I fell
                    into the habit of reading a lot. At first I read everything I caught hold of but the order I grew
                    the more definite my tastes in books became.

                    I took to reading historic books, books about adventures. I read very much technics books about
                    computers and all that connect to it such as mathematics, phisics, programming and others. Now I
                    think about this, I come to the conclusion I should be grateful to my parents for this habit: they
                    themselves read much and encourage my reading. I am sure books will be my friends all my life. In my
                    last year of schooling I often wondered what I would be in future, what sphere of life I should
                    choose. After a number of heated discussions with my parents and friends I decided to dwell my
                    choice on applied mathematics. I think I shall make a good mathematician.</p>
